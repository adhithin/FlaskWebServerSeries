# Grading 

***Overall Team Grade***

**39/40:** The web portfolio is working perfectly, it showcases all the group's projects and goals.The Pokemon game was successful and complete. It ran on both IntelliJ and, repl.it as well as was able to be deployed on a raspberry Ï€. The game was integrated into the Night at the Museum. However, the game did have some bugs and flaws as if the wrong thing was typed into the terminal, the game needed to be re-ran, hence, 1 point was taken.
